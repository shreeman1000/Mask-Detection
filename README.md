# Mask-Detection
This project was made following the tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLngCtsG3bk&list=PLVtdmB3NbT53Bpq03Lbl8eyB7hbKOwhCI&index=3&t=933s on youtube.
I was unable to upload the weights file due to large size.
This project uses the yolov3 object detection model (darknet) to detect peoples faces then classify them as wearing mask or not wearing mask.
The following is its classification on an image.

Yolov3 is a complex object detection model which gives output at 3 levels and in shapes 13x13, 26x26 and 52x52, it can be used train on upto 80 objects and works amazingly well.
